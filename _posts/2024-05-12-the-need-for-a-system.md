"if you fail at your consistency it's is the falure of your system to keep you consitent"

I'm 21 year old I wake full of energy able to bend steel with the weight of moral obligation to breakthough and achive but no amount of energy will made it possible for you to read an entire encyclopeida 1000 push up or complete the physics gre bottle necks such as information overload and mucle over load will made it so no matther how much force you put throught this factors will make it futile so the only path it's you have to channel this energy through building a system that will allow you to allways live at the edge and constanlty push for achivement
and why I think this is relevent for someone as poor and small as me I think that available information systems and all the access we have to collective intelligence allows someone with the small resource to build a system that embed scinitifc methods (agent based modeling recommender systems)
my approach it's a explorative one I will build a set of system each based on a scitifc methods then I will see If a pattern it's uncoverd or something cancelled out
